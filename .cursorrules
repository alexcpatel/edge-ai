## Debugging

- Diagnose the root cause before writing any code
- Test fix in ONE file before applying across many
- No speculative fixes without evidence

## New Code

- Clarify the intention, then implement ONE clear solution
- No fallbacks, excess error handling, or "just in case" code
- No inline comments or documentation until the approach is validated

## Always

- No README updates, docstrings, or explanatory comments unless explicitly asked
- Write clear, readable code—no magic, no code-in-strings, no cryptic awk/regex

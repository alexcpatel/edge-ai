name: Build Yocto Image

# This workflow builds the Yocto image on an EC2 instance.
# Uses OIDC for AWS authentication (no access keys needed) and EC2 Instance Connect for SSH (no private keys needed).
#
# Required setup:
# 1. Configure GitHub OIDC provider in AWS (done via Terraform)
# 2. Set AWS_ROLE_ARN secret in the "Yocto Builder" environment (get from Terraform output: github_actions_role_arn)
# 3. Ensure EC2 Instance Connect is enabled on the instance (Ubuntu 22.04 has it by default)

on:
  # Auto-run disabled - uncomment below to re-enable
  # push:
  #   branches:
  #     - main
